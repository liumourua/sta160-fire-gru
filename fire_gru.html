<h1>Short-term ignition (GRU) and post-fire hazard analysis</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Methods (summary)</h2>
  <p>
    We model daily wildfire ignition on a 10–15 km grid using a GRU with a learned
    spatial ignition prior and history-safe meteorological covariates. The GRU
    predicts the probability that at least one new fire occurs in the next
    7 or 14 days, with strict time splits between training (2013–2021),
    validation (2022), and test (2023–2025).
  </p>
  <p>
    For post-fire hazard, we merge ignitions within 3 days into a single episode
    and compute waiting times between episodes for each site. A discrete-time
    hazard model provides regional estimates of median inter-fire gaps and the
    probability of re-ignition within 30 or 60 days.
